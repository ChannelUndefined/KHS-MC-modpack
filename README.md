# KHS-MC-modpack

# Getting Started
You will need to install Fabric in order to use the required modpack.

There's two ways you can go about this, and you can choose either.
MultiMC, and Standard Installation.
If you already have MultiMC installed, this will be a breeze.

I recommend MultiMC simply because it allows you to easily create multiple installations with different mods, however initial installation can be slightly difficult for beginners.

If you just want to play on the KHS server, go with the Standard Installation

# MultiMC
MultiMC is a replacement Minecraft Client. It allows you to easily create new instances with different versions and loaders, and makes modding very easy.
You can get MultiMC from this link: https://multimc.org/#Download

- Step 1: Download it and install it on your PC.
- Step 2: Open MultiMC
- Step 3: Click "Add Instance" in the top lefthand corner
- Step 4: Select version 1.19.2, and name it what you'd like
- Step 5: Right click on your new instance, and select "Edit Instance"
- Step 6: Click "Install Fabric" on the right column, just below "Install Forge", and above "Install Quilt"
- Step 7: In the next popup menu, click OK

Congrats! Fabric is now installed for you!

# Standard (Manual) Installation
You will need the Minecraft Launcher installed on your PC.
Download the Fabric Installer from this link: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

- Step 1: Click the blue "Download for Windows" button
- Step 2: Open the downloaded file
- Step 3: Make sure you are on the "Client" tab and the Minecraft Version is set to 1.19.2. Leave Loader version and install location at defaults.
- Step 4: Check "Create profile", and click install
- Step 5: On the next popup, click OK
- Step 6: Open your Minecraft Launcher, and verify that "fabric-loader-1.19.2" is a valid profile by clicking the dropdown menu to the left of the "PLAY" button

Congrats! Fabric has been installed.
